A few years into his travels, during the Feast of the Traveller (a religious observance), he happens upon a group of slavers carousing in a tavern. He learns that they had decimated a town a little ways down the coast, and captured all the able bodied men to sell as slaves. In the spirit of the Feast, he decides to help free them. He ends up captured instead, and with a painful wound on his leg. Owing to the fact that he has killed a few of their companions, the slavers refuse to even mildly treat him, caring more about revenge than selling him. The wound gets infected, and he has to chop the leg off. The slavers refuse to sell him, instead keeping him on the ship for years. He is able to hide his magical nature form them for the first few years, but they discover his abilities during a failed escape attempt. He decides he has nothing more to lose, and burns the ship down after the most recent slaves have been sold. He fully expects to die himself, but survives, and washes up on the beach of some small coastal town. He spends a few months here, before deciding that he must once again wander the lands, playing cards, and taking up any opportunity he is presented with.
