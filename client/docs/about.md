# About

## Premise
Xorien's Lair aims to provide a theoretical replacement service to programs such as Roll20, D&D Beyond, and Fantasy Grounds in a single free-of-charge package. While its free nature and the fact that I've developed this by myself in my own free time means that certain niche features may be lacking, the system currently provides a viable way of efficiently managing characters & running combat encounters. This version, XL3, is the third iteration on the designs for this software I've created, and is by far the grandest in scope and functionality.

## Who is this "Xorien" person and why does he have a lair?
Xorien Mechanos is the first and favorite D&D character I ever created. He was an elven wizard who embodied pure chaos, and simply wanted to amass all the gold and magic he could while speaking in a bad British accent. He now resides in Limbo, as I've retired him to play other characters. I'm pretty sure his lair is somewhere there, but I'm honestly not sure.

## A quick note, before you begin
I am currently a high-school student, and this project is actually a school assignment at its heart. Due to this, I don't really have the capacity to maintain and host this tool past what I want to use it for, meaning instability is likely. However, given time and resources, it could be expanded to full functionality and be able to compete against similar platforms. All the code is open-source, and currently lives [HERE](https://github.com/iTecAI/XL3/tree/master). Additionally - this documentation assumes that you are already familiar with D&D 5e.
